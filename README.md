This is my first project i'll be pushing to github. It is a countdown application i built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. I hope to continue updating my Github profile with wonderful and beautiful projects.

This countdown project is mainly designed for my birthday sake. Trying out the functionality and sharpening my javascript skills.

First of all, I created the lay out with HTML and I beautified the page with CSS. Lastly, I made it work with Javascript.
